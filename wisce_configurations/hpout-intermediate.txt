* Register operations have the following format:
*
*      <register> <value> <access_type> <action> [<dev_addr>] [<mask>]
*
* where:
*      <register>      is the register index
*      <value>         is the data value
*      <access_type>   is one of:
*          AC97_16_bit_data
*          3wire_9_bit_data
*          2wire_9_bit_data
*      <action>        is one of
*          Write         - write the given value
*          Read          - documents the value that was read
*          RModW         - read/modify/write
*                          (newval = (currval & ~<mask>) | <value>)
*      <dev_addr>      is the 2wire device address
*      <mask>          is the mask for the RModW operation
*
* for example:
*   R12  0x1234  AC97_16_bit_data Write
*     - this would write the hex value 0x1234 to register 12 (decimal)
*       using AC97
*
*   R36  0x1F5   2wire_9_bit_data Write 0x34
*     - this would write the hexadecimal value 0x1F5 to register
*       36 (decimal) on the 2-wire device at address 0x34 (hex)
*
*   0xC  4660    AC97_16_bit_data Write
*   0x24 501     2wire_9_bit_data Write 0x34
*     - these are the same two operations using hexadecimal registers
*       and decimal values
*
* Lines beginning with// are comments and are ignored when processing
* the file.
*
* The register index can be written either in decimal format, prefixed by 'R'
* or in hexadecimal format, prefixed by '0x'.
*
* For 9-bit 2- and 3-wire operations, <value> is the actual 9 bit register
* contents, NOT the 16 bit data word.
*
* Entries in a line can be separated by spaces or tabs. The amount of
* space between each entry does not matter but entries must be arranged
* in the correct order from left to right. A file can be created in a text
* editor (e.g. Notepad), or created in Excel and saved as .txt format
* (tab separated).
